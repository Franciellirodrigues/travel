## üöÄ How it works

1. Frontend (travel-frontend folder)

üí° The Frontend needs the Backend to be running to work.

### Pre-requisites
Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine: [Git] (https://git-scm.com), [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/). In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode] (https://code.visualstudio.com/)


#### üß≠ Running the web application (Frontend)

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:Franciellirodrigues/travel.git

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd travel

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm run dev

# The application will open on the port: 3000 - go to http://localhost:3000
```
